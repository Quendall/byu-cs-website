# byu-cs-website
 An overhaul of the BYU Computer Science Website.

The goal is to create a website that provides information about the CS department to prospective students and other onlookers, as well as provide tools and resources to enrolled students to use in their CS classes.

This website in the future may be split into to main pages: one for enrolled students that provides tools, recources, and event information, and one for others looking to learn more about the department.
